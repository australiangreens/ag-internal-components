## Regarding baseUrl

Using a `baseUrl` of 'src' in `tsconfig.json` would allow use to non-relative
modules names. E.g. `import AgThemeProvider from 'components/AgThemeProvider';`.
However we don't do this because it messes up our Rollup `external` option in
`vite.config.ts`. That relies on all local imports to start with a '.', to avoid
a problem with bundling dependencies and replacing external import paths with
local paths.

There is undoubtedly a better way of doing it, and in the future we can fix
this. However at the time it was not a priority.

Also, each component will likely be relatively stand alone, so using relative
paths for local imports unlikely to be arduous, at least in the near term.
